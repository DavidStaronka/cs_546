                    In the 5th grade, we went to "Outdoor School" for a week in the Spring, which was basically a school-sponsored summer camp.
                    I absolutely loved it and still have a little notebook back home that I jotted down some scattered thoughts in for the first
                    couple of days before it got away from me.

                    In the aforementioned class, for one chapter we were given the option of making a mini-documentary with our friends on all 
                    things water instead of taking a test, which obviously means that no one took a test that chapter. Two of my friends and I
                    took the whole day with one of their moms driving us all over the county to film this video, which was approximately 90% just
                    the three of us being idiots on camera.

                    Probably the best memory I have here is the cantare, our high school chamber choir. A pretty broad subject, I'll admit,
                    But across my 4 years in the group, I made so many good friends that impacted my life for the better at a time when I
                    needed that really badly.

                    Freshman year, my friends and I would regularly go on walks around Hoboken at night. One night we brought a tennis ball
                    and sat in the gazebo by the waterfront in the park by the train station and passed it around just talking for hours.
                    I think that was one of the moments that really solidified our group early on.
